# coarse-to-fine DIOF

### dynamic illumination optical flow computing


We implemented the multi-resolution optical flow which can deal with illumination changes.

The dynamic illumination optical flow computing aims at solving the velocity field based on the following loss functionï¼š

This program is originally implemented to perform motion-based object detection. **However, in this project, we apply the DIOF method to extract motion field of fluid flow from particle images**.



### Usage:  Run the script main.m  
  
### Example:

The images of this example are originally provided by FLUID - http://fluid.irisa.fr/data-eng.htm  

And we add synthetic brightness change to the second image frame.
